# Instructions to Run the Report Generator

## Overview
The program automatically discovers CSV files and photo files in the same folder and generates comprehensive battery analysis reports in PDF and Word formats.

## How to Run
1. Place all CSV data files and photo files in the same folder as `report_generator.py`.
2. Open a terminal/PowerShell in that folder.
3. Activate the virtual environment (if needed):
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python report_generator.py
   ```
5. Reports will be generated in a `reports/` subfolder automatically.

## What the Script Does
- **📊 Loads CSV data**: Processes battery system data from CSV files
- **⏳ Resamples data**: Converts raw data into consistent time intervals
- **Calculates metrics**: Computes electrical, thermal, and efficiency metrics
- **📈 Generates plots**: Creates 13 different analysis plots
- **📝 Builds reports**: Generates PDF and Word documents with all analysis and visualizations

## Progress Indicators
While running, you'll see messages like:
- `📊 Processing file:` - Currently loading and processing a CSV file
- `⏳ Resampling data...` - Converting raw data to fixed intervals
- `✓ Metrics calculated successfully` - Metrics computation is complete
- `📈 Generating plots...` - Creating visualization plots
- `✓ Generated:` - Each plot file creation
- `📝 Building PDF report...` - PDF document generation
- `📝 Building Word report...` - Word document generation
- `🎉 Report generation complete!` - All reports are done

## Processing Time
Processing may take 5-15 minutes depending on your computer and data size. Large datasets (1M+ rows) require more time for:
- CSV parsing
- Data resampling
- Plot generation
- Report compilation

**Be patient and let the script complete** - you will see progress messages indicating what's happening.

## Output Files
Reports are saved in the `reports/` folder with timestamps:
- `battery_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf` - PDF report
- `battery_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.docx` - Word report

## Report Sections
The generated reports include:
1. **Electrical Performance** - Voltage range, peak power, average power (per shift)
2. **Energy Efficiency** - Distance covered, total energy consumed (per shift)
3. **SOC Analysis** - Initial/Final SOC and depletion (per shift)
4. **Ride Mode Analysis** - Performance by ride mode with tables and plots
5. **Thermal Performance** - Temperature analysis from sensors
6. **Charge/Discharge Profile** - Battery status distribution analysis

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **No CSV files found**: Ensure .csv files are in the same folder as the script
- **Reports not generating**: Check the console for error messages and ensure you have write permissions
